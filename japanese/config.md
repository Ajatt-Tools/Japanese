### Profiles

Each profile defines
Note Type constraints,
fields to generate data for
and fields where the generated data should be placed.
By default, the add-on matches a note type
if it finds the text "japanese" in the note type name.
Case is ignored.

Default field names match the [TSC](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1557722832) note type.

### Furigana

* `skip_numbers`. Whether to add furigana to numbers or not.
* `prefer_literal_pronunciation`.
  The database has readings with the `ー` symbol in place of long vowels.
  Prioritize them, and use single kana to show equivalent sounds, e.g. `を` and `お`.
* `reading_separator`. String used to separate multiple readings of one word. For example, `<br>` or `,`.
* `blocklisted_words`. Furigana won't be added to these words. Comma-separated.
* `mecab_only`. A comma-separated list of words that don't need to be looked up in the database.
* `maximum_results`. Used when database lookups are enabled. Will abort if fetched more results than this number.

### Pitch accent

* `lookup_shortcut`.
  The shortcut to perform pronunciation lookup
  on the selected text ("Tools" > "NHK pitch accent lookup").
* `output_hiragana`.
  Print readings using hiragana instead of katakana.
* `kana_lookups`.
  If failed to find pitch accent for a word,
  make an attempt to look it up using its kana reading.
  Works better if `split_morphemes` is set to `true` in the profile.
* `skip_numbers`. Don't lookup numbers.
* `reading_separator`. String used to separate different readings of one word.
* `word_separator`. String used to separate words.
* `blocklisted_words`. A comma-separated list of words that you don't want to look up.
* `maximum_results`. Abort if fetched more results than this number.
